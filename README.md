Classification of Different animal using CNN

So this dataset contains files which are images of animals where photos from unsplash , pixabay , pixals .
There are five kind of animals in here that is:

1. Jaguar
2. Lion
3. Leopard
4. Cheetah
5. Tiger

Since the data is very small so it needs augmentation because the model is overfitting.
The repo contains two files where in first file is trained on the model where in the training set only consist of images in the true dataset while in the second file, the model is trained with the additional augmented images as well.
The model is a CNN which does not have very dense layers because that may lead to overfitting.

Will also add the transfer learning to it soon...
